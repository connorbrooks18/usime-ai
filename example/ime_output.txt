{"confusions":"1. Records list four identical ER visits on 06/03/2025 at four different hospitals with the same history, exam, and assessment, which is atypical and may reflect duplicate or erroneous entries.\n2. Primary care notes from ten different dates (2024–2025) are virtually identical, suggesting data duplication rather than discrete clinical encounters.\n3. Physical therapy records list twelve separate therapists all treating the patient on the same day with identical notes, which is inconsistent with usual practice patterns.\n4.

Vazquez, Everett, McIntosh, Simmons, Sims, Villarreal, Wilson, Rojas, Lee, Velasquez (2024–2025)\n•  Physical therapy notes (06/03/2025)\n•  MRI reports, Gonzalez-Yang (07/28/2024), Williams & Sons (12/15/2024), Martinez-Hart-Reyes (10/28/2024), Marquez-Pope-Harrison (01/07/2025), Willis-Brown (01/09/2025), Harris-Cole (01/18/2025)\n\nINTERVIEW FINDINGS:\nMr. Doe is a 50-year-old male who fell from farm equipment on 06/03/2025, landing on his feet and jarring his low back. He has a long history of chronic low back pain attributed to L4-L5 disc degeneration. Since the fall, he reports his baseline pain (4/10) increased to 7/10, aggravated by standing, bending, and lifting. He describes difficulty with activities such as driving, household chores, and recreational pursuits (e.g., skiing). He denies substantial relief from rest and over-the-counter analgesics.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n•  General: Well-nourished, no acute distress.\n•  Spinal inspection: Mild lumbar paraspinal muscle spasm, no deformity.\n•  Range of motion: Flexion 50° (normal 90°), extension 10° (normal 30°); lateral bending 15° bilaterally (normal 25°).\n•  Neurological: Strength 5/5 throughout lower extremities; sensation intact to pinprick; reflexes 2+ bilaterally; negative straight-leg raise.\n•  Special tests: No evidence of non-organic (Waddell) signs; pain behavior consistent with organic findings.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:\nSerial lumbar MRIs consistently demonstrate chronic L4-L5 disc degeneration with mild posterior bulge, no evidence of acute disc herniation or fracture.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Chronic lumbar spine degenerative disc disease at L4-L5, baseline-related low back pain.\n2. Acute lumbar strain superimposed on chronic degeneration from 06/03/2025 fall, resulting in temporary exacerbation of symptoms.\n3. No evidence of new structural injury (fracture or significant herniation).\n\nDEGREE OF IMPAIRMENT:\nUsing AMA Guides, Fifth Edition, Chapter 15 (DRE Lumbar Category II), I assign 5% whole person impairment, which reflects chronic degenerative disease with intermittent exacerbations. No additional permanent impairment attributable solely to the 06/03/2025 incident beyond baseline.\n\nCAUSATION / AGGRAVATION:\nThe 06/03/2025 fall more likely than not aggravated Mr. Doe’s pre-existing lumbar disc degeneration, causing an acute strain and transient increase in pain and functional limitation. The underlying degenerative condition, however, remains the primary driver of his chronic symptoms.\n\nCONTRIBUTORY FAULT:\nThere is no objective evidence that Mr. Doe’s conduct fell below the standard of care for safe equipment operation. His fall appears accidental and related to occupational hazard rather than personal negligence. I attribute 0% fault to Mr. Doe.\n\nCREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT:\nNo objective findings or Waddell signs suggest exaggeration or malingering. Mr. Doe’s reported pain and functional limitations are consistent with chronic disc degeneration and recent strain.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n•  Continue conservative management: physical therapy focused on core stabilization, home exercise program.\n•  Consider short-term NSAIDs and a one-week trial of muscle relaxants for acute exacerbation.\n•  If pain persists beyond 6 weeks, consider lumbar epidural steroid injection.\n\nANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:\n1. Is there impairment? Yes. I assign 5% whole person impairment for chronic L4-L5 degenerative disc disease (DRE II). No new permanent impairment from the recent fall.\n2. Did the accident aggravate or cause the impairment? The fall aggravated his pre-existing condition, causing an acute lumbar strain and temporary pain increase but did not produce new structural damage.\n3. How much fault is on the client? 0%—no evidence of negligence on Mr. Doe’s part.\n4. Thorough exam and check for lying: Physical exam revealed objective limitation of lumbar range of motion without non-organic pain behavior. No evidence of malingering or symptom exaggeration.\n\nPrepared by:\n\nDr. Alice M.
