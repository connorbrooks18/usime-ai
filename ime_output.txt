{"confusions":"1. Multiple identical emergency room visits and physical therapy sessions recorded on 2025-06-03 at different facilities/with different therapists are highly improbable and likely reflect duplicated or OCR-related errors.  2. Repeated identical primary care notes and MRI reports across various dates suggest data redundancy.  3. No post-accident imaging exists to confirm or refute new structural injury.","report":"June 5, 2025\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nRE: John Doe\nDOB: 03/15/1975\nDate of Evaluation: 06/05/2025\n\nPURPOSE OF EVALUATION:\nAt the request of counsel for Mr. John Doe, I conducted an independent medical evaluation (IME) to assess his lumbar spine status, determine impairment, evaluate causation related to a 06/03/2025 fall, and screen for non-organic pain behaviors.\n\nRECORDS REVIEWED:\n• Emergency department notes dated 06/03/2025 (Pennington-Smith, Golden-Marsh, Clark Ramsey & Jarvis, Lam-Porter): acute back pain, no findings of fracture or soft-tissue injury.\n• Primary care notes (06/30/2024–05/03/2025): chronic low back pain, exacerbated by standing; history of lumbar disc degeneration; continued PT recommended.\n• Physical therapy progress notes (06/03/2025): core stabilization and manual therapy; slight improvement, persistent limited lumbar range of motion.\n• MRI reports (07/28/2024–01/18/2025): L4–L5 disc degeneration with mild posterior bulge; no acute findings.\n• Unrelated dermatology records (2023–2024): no musculoskeletal relevance.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMr. Doe, a 50-year-old male farm equipment operator, reports chronic lumbar pain due to L4–L5 degeneration. On 06/03/2025 he slipped from a tractor, landing on his feet with a jolt to his back. He experienced increased pain but denied radicular symptoms. No immediate imaging post-fall demonstrated acute injury.\n\nINTERVIEW FINDINGS:\nHe describes his baseline pain as 4–6/10, increasing to 7/10 after the fall, aggravated by standing and bending. He reports moderate difficulty with daily activities (e.g., lifting, prolonged standing). He also stated moderate difficulty with higher-level tasks (e.g., skiing), which appears inconsistent with his reported functional limitations.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral: Well-nourished male in no acute distress. Vital signs within normal limits.\nSpine: Inspection—no deformity; palpation—mild paraspinal tenderness at L4–L5, but no step-offs. ROM—forward flexion 60° (normal 90°), extension 10° (normal 25°), lateral bending 15° bilaterally (normal 25°); rotations mildly limited; movements reproduce mild discomfort without radicular pain.\nNeurologic: Motor strength 5/5 in lower extremities; deep tendon reflexes 2+ and symmetric at knees and ankles; sensation intact to light touch and pinprick; negative straight-leg raise bilaterally.\nNon-organic signs: No Waddell’s signs (no superficial or non-anatomic tenderness, no variability on distracted testing, appropriate regional pain distribution).\nGait and posture: Normal without antalgic pattern.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:\nRecent imaging confirms chronic L4–L5 degeneration without new herniation or fracture. No post-fall imaging was performed.\n\nIMPRESSIONS:\n1. Chronic L4–L5 disc degeneration with mild posterior bulge—stable and longstanding.  \n2. No evidence of acute lumbar injury from the 06/03/2025 fall.  \n3. Functional limitations are consistent with chronic degenerative disease, not new structural damage.  \n4. No evidence of non-organic pain behaviors or malingering.\n\nOPINIONS:\n1. Does Mr. Doe have impairment?  Yes. He has a moderate, chronic impairment attributable to L4–L5 degeneration, reflected by measurable loss of lumbar ROM and activity limitations.\n2. Did the 06/03/2025 fall cause or aggravate impairment?  Transiently, yes—acute exacerbation of pain—but there is no objective evidence of new or worsened structural injury. His permanent impairment remains attributable to his preexisting degenerative condition.\n3. Client fault apportionment:  Medical evaluation is not designed to assign legal liability. Based on history, the fall resulted from his own misstep from equipment; any legal fault determination should be made by the trier of fact.\n4. Malingering assessment:  No examination findings suggest exaggeration or non-organic pain. His subjective reports align with objective findings.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n• Continue conservative management: core stabilization, graded physical therapy, and activity modification.  \n• Consider periodic re-evaluation if new neurologic signs or imaging changes develop.  \n\nThis opinion is provided to a reasonable degree of medical certainty and is independent of any requestor influence.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Physician Name], M.D.\nBoard-Certified in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation\nIndependent Medical Examiner"}
